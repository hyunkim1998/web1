  <h2>NSE는 어떤 전공인가?</h2>
  <p>Today, I will be introducing our major <strong><u>Nano Science and Engineering.</u></strong> Our major is a part of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/isedyonsei/" target="_blank" title="ISED facebook page">Intergrated Science and Engineering Divison</a>. Freshman will complete their first year in ISED and then will be able to apply to our major or the other two majors in ISED.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">Our major is typically known as the most job ready major in ISED. However, myself including other upper classmen insist that students do not choose this major for this simple reason. Our major is extremely difficult and requires an amount of interest for indept studies. Therefore, students who are not engaged into the basic principles of nano science and engineering, they will lose interest in their studies.</p>
